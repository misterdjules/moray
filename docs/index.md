# Moray

This is the reference documentation for Moray, which is a key-value store built
on top of [Manatee](https://github.com/joyent/manatee/) and
[fast](https://github.com/joyent/node-fast).  For general information about
Moray, see the [README](https://github.com/joyent/moray).

This documentation provides descriptions of the APIs that Moray offers, as well
as how to use the (node.js) [client SDK](https://mo.joyent.com/node-moray) to
interact with Moray.

## Conventions

Any content formatted like this:

    $ getbucket foo

is a command-line example that you can run from a shell. All other examples and
information are formatted like this:

    client.createBucket(foo, {}, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });


# Overview

Moray allows you to store arbitrary JSON documents (called **objects**) inside
namespaces called **buckets**.  Buckets can have **indexes**, which are
top-level fields that are extracted so that search operations using those fields
can be executed efficiently.  Indexes can also be used to enforce uniqueness of
a value.  Since buckets are essentially namespaces, bucket `foo` can have a key
`mykey` and bucket `bar` can have a key `mykey` with different values.

There is no limit on the number of buckets, nor on the number of keys in a
bucket.  That said, a single Moray instance is backed by a single logical
Postgres instance, so you are practically limited to how much data you can
maintain.

The basic operations on objects in a bucket are `put`, `get`, and `delete`.
`search`, `update`, and `deleteMany` are also supported using filter strings
that operate on indexed fields.

You define a bucket's indexes when you initially create the bucket.  When you
write an object, the value of each indexed field is updated in the server-side
index for that field.  You can update a bucket's indexes later, but objects
already written in that bucket will need to be reindexed.

Indexes can be defined to be of type `number`, `boolean`, `string`, `ip` or
`subnet`.  Index names must:

- Contain only Latin letters, Arabic numerals, and underscores.
- Start with a Latin letter or an underscore.
- Not end with an underscore.
- When starting with an underscore, not contain any further underscores.
- Not start with `moray`.
- Not be a reserved name (`_etag`, `_id`, `_key`, `_atime`, `_ctime`, `_mtime`,
  `_rver`, `_txn_snap`, `_value`, or `_vnode`).

Moray also supports multi-valued entries such that indexing still works (mostly)
as expected.  There's an example later in this document under "Using Arrays".


# Basic MorayClient usage

You can install the node-moray client library and CLI tools using:

    $ npm install moray

Or, to install the CLI tools and manual pages on your path:

    $ npm install -g moray

The CLI tools have detailed manual pages.  Start with `moray(1)` for an
overview.

The library interface has an overview manual page `moray(3)` that describes how
to initialize the client for Triton and Manta services and CLI tools.  The API
documentation below includes examples of using both the CLI tools and Node
client library interfaces.  It's worth reviewing `moray(1)` and `moray(3)` to
understand the basic conventions used below.


# Buckets

## CreateBucket

Creates a new bucket given a name and a `config` object.  The `config` object
defines an `index` section and optionally a `pre`, `post` array of trigger
functions.  Also, note that buckets can be versioned, such that subsequent
updates will fail if the version rolls backwards.

### API

A "fully loaded" config (without post triggers) would look like this:

    var cfg = {
        index: {
            email: {
                type: "string",
                unique: true
            },
            userid: {
                type: "number",
                unique: true
            },
            ismanager: {
                type: "boolean"
            }
        },
        pre: [
            function enforceEmail(req, cb) {
                if (!req.value.email)
                    return (cb(new Error('email is required')));

                return (cb());
            },
            function setUID(req, cb) {
                req.value.userid = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100001);
                cb();
            }
        ],
        options: {
            version: 1
        }
    }

    client.createBucket('foo', cfg, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| name     | string   | globally unique name for the bucket             |
| config   | object   | configuration (indexes/pre/post) for the bucket |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id)               |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`                          |

### Errors

* `InvalidBucketConfigError`
* `InvalidBucketNameError`
* `InvalidIndexDefinitionError`
* `NoDatabaseError`
* `NotFunctionError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

### CLI

To add that config above, you can use this invocation (`-s says wait for stdin`):

    $ putbucket -s foo < test.json

Or if you're not using triggers (more common, actually):

    $ putbucket -u email -u userid:number -i ismanager:boolean foo

Note there is no `createbucket` command; `putbucket` wraps up `CreateBucket` and
`UpdateBucket`.

## GetBucket

Returns the configuration for the bucket only.  There really are no options here
besides the name of the bucket you want to fetch (and of course request\_id).

### API

     client.getBucket('foo', function (err, bucket) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        console.log(util.inspect(bucket));
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                         |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| name     | string   | globally unique name for the bucket |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id)   |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`              |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `NoDatabaseError`

### CLI

    $ getbucket foo

    {
      "name": foo",
      "index": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        },
        "userid": {
          "type": "number",
          "unique": true
        },
        "ismanager": {
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      },
      "pre": [
        "function enforceEmail(req, cb) {
           if (!req.value.email) {
             return (cb(new Error('email is required')));
           }
           return (cb());
         }",
        "function setUID(req, cb) {
          req.value.userid = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100001);
          cb();
        }"
      ],
      "post": [],
      "mtime": "2012-07-31T19:43:32.268Z"
    }

Note the `\n's` inside the `pre` functions were inserted for readability in this
document; they were not actually returned, and are not legal JSON.

## ListBuckets

Returns the configuration for all buckets.

### API

     client.listBuckets(function (err, buckets) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        console.log(util.inspect(buckets));
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                       |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id) |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`            |

### Errors

* `NoDatabaseError`

### CLI

    $ listbuckets
    [{
      "name": foo",
      "index": {
        "email": {
          "type": "string",
          "unique": true
        },
        "userid": {
          "type": "number",
          "unique": true
        },
        "ismanager": {
          "type": "boolean"
        }
      },
      "pre": [
        "function enforceEmail(req, cb) {
           if (!req.value.email) {
             return (cb(new Error('email is required')));
           }
           return (cb());
         }",
        "function setUID(req, cb) {
          req.value.userid = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100001);
          cb();
        }"
      ],
      "post": [],
      "mtime": "2012-07-31T19:43:32.268Z"
    }]

Note the `\n's` inside the `pre` functions were inserted for readability in this
document; they were not actually returned, and are not legal JSON.

## UpdateBucket

Updates a bucket given a name and a `config` object.  Basically, looks exactly
like `CreateBucket`.  The only reason we have `create|update bucket` and not
`putBucket` is so that users can selectively _not_ stomp all over a bucket if
they don't intend to (note there is a `putBucket` API in the client).

The `version` param in options is required if you are using versioned buckets,
and an error will be thrown if the version you are sending is `<=` than the
version in the database.

Note that if you *add* new indexes via `updateBucket`, then any *new* data will
be indexed accordingly, but _old_ data will not.  See the ReindexObjects
function for a method to update old rows. (A bucket version _must_ be specified
for `reindexObjects` to work.)

Also, note that all operations involving the bucket configuration in Moray will
use a cached copy of the bucket configuration, so it may take a few minutes for
your update to take effect.  This caching can be overridden during subsequent
operations by setting the `noBucketCache` option to true.

### API

    var cfg = {
        index: {
            email: {
                type: "string",
                unique: true
            },
            userid: {
                type: "number",
                unique: true
            }
        },
        pre: [],
        post: []
    }

    client.updateBucket('foo', cfg, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

Or alternatively:

    client.putBucket('foo', cfg, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| name     | string   | globally unique name for the bucket             |
| config   | object   | configuration (indexes/pre/post) for the bucket |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id)               |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`                          |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `InvalidBucketConfigError`
* `InvalidIndexDefinitionError`
* `NoDatabaseError`
* `NotFunctionError`

### CLI

    $ putbucket -s foo < test.json
    $ putbucket -u email -u userid:number foo

## DeleteBucket

Deletes a bucket, *and all data in that bucket!*

### API

     client.delBucket('foo', function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                         |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| name     | string   | globally unique name for the bucket |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id)   |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`              |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `NoDatabaseError`

### CLI

    $ delbucket foo

# Objects

With the exception of `ReindexObjects`, the object-related methods in Moray use
a cache for bucket information.  When a bucket is updated, say to alter its
index columns, stale data will persist in the bucket cache for up to 300
seconds.  For object operations that absolutely require current bucket
information, setting the `noBucketCache` option will bypass that cache.

## PutObject

Creates or overwrites an object given a bucket, key and value.  The bucket must
obviously already exist, and the key can be any string at all.  The value must
be a JS object of any form that can be run through `JSON.stringify()`.  Any keys
in the object that match the names of those defined in the bucket's `index`
section are indexed, and available for searching later.

As far as options, besides the usual `req_id`, notably you can set the flag
`etag`, which will make moray _atomically_ test/set your new value (this is
useful if you're implementing something like a lock semantic).  To ensure that
you're "creating" a record that never existed, set etag to `null`, otherwise set
it to the value of the last known version of `etag` you have.  If the etag differs
you'll receive an `EtagConflictError` which, in addition to your being able to
switch on the name, is decorated with the info you need; a sample `.toString()`
looks like:

    {
        name: 'EtagConflictError',
        message: '...',
        context: {
            bucket: 'moray_unit_test_2423db7',
            key: '4ddb630b-cc3d-4ff7-bbb4-168cd005cbc0',
            expected: 'ABCDEFGH',
            actual: 'B21548FF'
        }
    }

### API

    var data = {
        email: 'mark.cavage@joyent.com',
        ismanager: false
    };
    client.putObject('foo', 'mcavage', data, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                             |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| bucket   | string   | bucket to write this key in             |
| key      | string   | bucket to write this key in             |
| value    | object   | free-form JS object                     |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id, etag) |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`                  |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `EtagConflictError`
* `NoDatabaseError`
* `UniqueAttributeError`
* `InvalidIndexTypeError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

### CLI

    $ putobject -d '{"email": "mark.cavage@joyent.com"}' foo mcavage

## GetObject

Retrieves an object by bucket and key.

The `_txn_snap` field represents the postgres internal transaction *snapshot*
that corresponds to when this record was written (specifically the `xmin`
component).  To really understand this, you probably want to go read up on how
[MVCC is implemented in
postgres](http://momjian.us/main/writings/pgsql/internalpics.pdf); specifically
pp56-58.  The short of it is, for records in Moray, it is possible that more
than one record will have the same `_txn_snap` value, so you cannot rely on it
as a unique id.  You also cannot rely on this value to increase over time.
Objects with later `_txn_snap` values can be visible before objects with earlier
`_txn_snap` values.

### API

    client.getObject('foo', 'mcavage', function (err, obj) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        console.log(util.inspect(obj));
    });

Would output an object that has the attributes `bucket`, `key`, `value`, `_id`,
`_etag`, `_mtime` (in epoch time) and `_txn_snap`.  If all you care about is the
original user-set value, just use `obj.value`.  See the example CLI output below
for a full example.

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                                |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| bucket   | string   | bucket to write this key in                |
| key      | string   | bucket to write this key in                |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id, noCache) |
| callback | function | arguments of `err` and `obj`               |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `ObjectNotFoundError`
* `NoDatabaseError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

### CLI

    $ getobject foo mcavage

    {
      "bucket": "foo",
      "key": "mcavage",
      "value": {
        "email": "mark.cavage@joyent.com",
        "userid": 54408
       },
       "_id": 1,
       "_etag": "D4DC3CFE",
       "_mtime": 1343724604354,
       "_txn_snap": 8349
    }

## FindObjects

Allows you to query a bucket for a set of records that match indexed fields.
Note this is not a streaming API.  (Pagination must be implemented by consumers,
if desired.)

Search filters are fully specified according to search filters resembling LDAP
filter rules.  All fields included in your search query should be indexed in the
bucket config, though the server only enforces that at least one field that's
used to limit the result set is indexed (to avoid an obvious case where a table
scan is required).  **Surprising behavior results when searching with
non-indexed fields, and this is strongly discouraged.**  For details, see
`findobjects(1)`.

In addition to the search filter, you can specify `limit`, `offset`, and `sort`;
the first two act like they usually do in DBs, and `sort` must be a JSON object
specifying the attribute to sort by, and an order, which is one of `ASC` or
`DESC` (so also like DBs).  The default `limit` setting is `1000`. There is no
default `offset`.  The default `sort` order is `ASC`, and the default attribute
is `_id` (which means records are returned in the order they were created or
updated).

### API

Note that the client API is implemented as an `EventEmitter`, as you should
expect to receive back up to N records from this call.

    var opts = {
        sort: {
           attribute: 'userid',
           order: 'DESC'
        }
    };
    var req = client.findObjects('foo', '(email=*@joyent.com)', opts);

    req.once('error', function (err) {
        console.error(err.stack);
        process.exit(1);
    });

    req.on('record', function (obj) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(obj, null, 2));
    });

    req.on('end', function () {
       ...
    });


### Inputs

| Field   | Type   | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bucket  | string | bucket to search in                                    |
| filter  | string | search filter string                                   |
| options | object | any optional parameters (req\_id, limit, offset, sort, requireIndexes) |

#### requireIndexes option

When passing `requireIndexes: true`, `findObjects` requests will respond with a
`NotIndexedError` error if at least one of the fields included in the search
filter has an index that can't be used.

When not passing any value for `requireIndexes`, the behavior depends on what
`requireIndexes` value was passed to the moray client's constructor.

Regardless of the moray client's configuration, passing `requireIndexes: false`
to `findObjects` will disable this behavior.

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `InvalidQueryError`
* `NoDatabaseError`
* `NotIndexedError`
* `InvalidIndexTypeError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

### CLI

    $ findobjects -d email foo "(email=*@joyent.com)"
    {
      "bucket": "foo",
      "key": "yunong",
      "value": {
        "email": "yunong@joyent.com",
        "userid": 74265
      },
      "_id": 4,
      "_etag": "09D27A3F",
      "_mtime": 1343726032177,
      "_txn_snap": 7894
    }
    {
      "bucket": "foo",
      "key": "mcavage",
      "value": {
        "email": "mark.cavage@joyent.com",
        "userid": 54408
      },
      "_id": 1,
      "_etag": "D4DC3CFE",
      "_mtime": 1343724604354,
      "_txn_snap": 7882
    }
    {
      "bucket": "foo",
      "key": "dap",
      "value": {
        "email": "dap@joyent.com",
        "userid": 23175
      },
      "_id": 3,
      "_etag": "84C510D7",
      "_mtime": 13437260263184,
      "_txn_snap": 7894
    }

## DeleteObject

Deletes an object by bucket/key.  Like `PutObject`, you can set an `etag` in
options to get `test/set` semantics.

### API

    var opts = {
        etag: 'D4DC3CFE'
    };
    client.delObject('foo', 'mcavage', opts, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                             |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| bucket   | string   | bucket to delete this key from          |
| key      | string   | key to delete                           |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id, etag) |
| callback | function | only argument is `err`                  |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `EtagConflictError`
* `ObjectNotFoundError`
* `NoDatabaseError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

### CLI

    $ delobject foo mcavage


## UpdateObjects

Allows you to bulk update a set of objects in one transaction.  Note you can
only update indexed fields.  You call this API with a bucket, a list of fields
to update and a filter, that is exactly the same syntax as `findObjects`.

A few caveats:

- All objects affected by the update will have the same `_etag`.
- The `JSON value` will *not* be updated in situ, though Moray hides this fact
  from you.  Subsequent "get" operations will merge the results into the
  returned value.

### API

    var attrs = {
        isManager: true
    };
    var filter = '(email=*@joyent.com)';
    var req = client.updateObjects('foo', attrs, filter, function (err, meta) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        console.log(meta.etag); // new etag for all updated objects
        ...
    });


### Inputs

| Field   | Type   | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bucket  | string | bucket to write this key in                            |
| fields  | object | keys and values to update                              |
| filter  | string | search filter string                                   |
| options | object | any optional parameters (req\_id, limit, offset, sort) |

## ReindexObjects

After performing an `updateBucket` which added index fields, `reindexObjects`
can be used to automatically re-write objects so that all index fields are
properly populated.  This operation does _not_ update the `mtime` or `etag`
fields on stale objects when they are re-indexed.  Since it requires a `count`
parameter to set the max rows per iteration, `reindexObjects` must be called
repeatedly until it reports 0 rows processed.  Only then will the added indexes
be made available for use.

The selected `count` value should be chosen with the expected bucket object size
in mind.  Too large a value can cause transactions to remain open for extended
periods, and may also cause Moray to consume excessive amounts of memory since
it's unable to exert backpressure on PostgreSQL when fetching rows.

It is safe to make multiple simultaneous calls to `reindexObjects` acting on
the same bucket but it's likely to race on rows and incur rollbacks/slowdowns.

### API

    var rowsPerCall = 100;
    client.reindexObjects('foo', rowsPerCall, function (err, res) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        // rows processed in this call (0 if indexes are complete)
        console.log(res.processed);
        // rows remaining to reindex (absent of no_count option set)
        console.log(res.remaining);
    });


### Inputs

| Field   | Type   | Description                                  |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| bucket  | string | bucket to reindex                            |
| count   | object | max rows to reindex                          |
| options | object | any optional parameters (req\_id, no\_count) |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `NoDatabaseError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

## DeleteMany

Allows you to bulk delete a set of objects in one transaction.  You call this
API with a bucket and a filter, that is exactly the same syntax as
`findObjects`.

### API

    var filter = '(email=*@joyent.com)';
    var req = client.deleteMany('foo', filter, function (err) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        ...
    });


### Inputs

| Field   | Type   | Description                                            |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| bucket  | string | bucket to delete from                                  |
| filter  | string | search filter string                                   |
| options | object | any optional parameters (req\_id, limit, offset, sort) |


## Batch

Allows you to transactionally write a list of put, update or delete operations.

If the type is `put`, each request creates or overwrites a list of
objects given a set of bucket/key/values.  The individual objects are
pretty much exactly what you would send to `putObject`, but in a list.
Note that all of the checks in putObject will be run, so you can send
in `etag` (notably) and enforcement will be done on an individual
record basis. Also, objects can span buckets in this API.

If the operation is `delete`, along with the object bucket/key, you can also
pass the same `opts` argument you do for `deleteObject`.

If the operation is `update`, you pass in what you would have to
`updateObjects`.

The default operation is `put`.

### API

    var data = [{
        bucket: 'foo',
        key: 'mcavage',
        value: {
            email: 'mark.cavage@joyent.com',
            ismanager: false
        }
    }, {
        bucket: 'foo',
        operation: 'update'
        fields: {
            email: 'mcavage@gmail.com'
        },
        filter: '(ismanager=false)'
    }, {
        bucket: 'bar',
        operation: 'delete'
        key: 'uniquething'
    }];
    client.batch(data, {req_id: '123'}, function (err, meta) {
        assert.ifError(err);
        console.log('etags: %j', meta.etags);
    });

### Inputs

| Field    | Type     | Description                                                       |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objects  | object   | bucket/key/value tuples to store                                  |
| options  | object   | any optional parameters (req\_id, etag)                           |
| callback | function | only argument is `err` and `meta` which will have a list of etags |

### Errors

* `BucketNotFoundError`
* `EtagConflictError`
* `NoDatabaseError`
* `UniqueAttributeError`

Plus any currently unhandled Postgres Errors (such as relation already exists).

# Other

## sql

An API that really only exists for two reasons:

1. for humans to quickly get some debug info from Moray
2. for systems like UFDS that need to create extra tables et al in Moray for
   `post` triggers.

The latter use-case (filling in gaps in the Moray API) is considered deprecated.

### API

    var req = client.sql('select * from buckets_config');
    req.on('record', function (r) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(r));
    });
    req.on('error', function (err) {
        ...
    });
    req.on('end', function () {
        ...
    });

### Inputs

| Field     | Type   | Description                          |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| statement | string | SQL statement to run                 |
| values    | Array  | values to insert (see node-postgres) |
| options   | object | any optional parameters (req\_id)    |

### CLI

    $ sql "select now() from buckets_config;"
    {
        "now": "2012-08-01T15:50:33.291Z"
    }

## Using Arrays

Here's a small example demonstrating how to use arrays:

    var assert = require('assert-plus');
    var moray = require('moray');

    var cfg = {
        index: {
            name: {
                type: '[string]'
            }
        }
    };
    var client = moray.createClient({...});
    client.putBucket('foo', cfg, function (bucket_err) {
        assert.ifError(bucket_err);

        var data = {
            something_irrelevant: 'blah blah',
            name: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']
        };
        client.putObject('foo', 'bar', data, function (put_err) {
            assert.ifError(put_err);

            var req = client.findObjects('foo', '(name=bar)');
            req.once('error', assert.ifError.bind(assert));
            req.on('record', ...);
            req.once('end', ...);
        });
    });

Array types work just like regular types, except they are defined by `[:type:]`,
and on writes, Moray knows how to index those properly.  On searches, the
contract is to return the record if _any_ of the array values match the filter
subclause.  There is one caveat:  _wildcard_ searches do not work (and can't).
So doing `(name=f*)` will return an error to you.  The reason is that Postgres
does not have any sane way of doing this (it is technically possible, but
expensive, and not currently implemented in Moray).

## Triggers

While a quasi-advanced topic, Moray does support `pre` and `post` "triggers" on
buckets, which are guaranteed to run before and after a write
(so put|del object) is performed.  You write them as just plain old JS functions
when you create your bucket, and note that they are guaranteed to run as part of
the transaction scope.  You typically will use `pre` triggers to transform
and/or validate data before being saved, and use `post` triggers to write an
audit log or some such thing (UFDS leverages `post` triggers to generate the
changelog).  They are guaranteed to run in the order you define them.  Note that
`pre` triggers only run before `putObject`, whereas `post` runs after both
`putObject` and `delObject`.

In general, you need to be super careful with these, as they run in the same VM
that Moray does, so any uncaught exception will bring down the whole server.
This is intentional for performance reasons.  Additionally, they run in the same
callback chain as the rest of the operation, so failure to invoke the callback
will stall the operation and leak the Postgres handle.  So basically, don't
screw up.

### pre

The definition for a `pre` trigger looks like this:

    function myPreTrigger(req, cb) {
        ....
        cb();
    }

Where `req` is an object like this:

    {
        bucket: 'foo',
        key: 'bar',
        log: <logger>,
        pg: <postgres handle>,
        schema: <index configuration>,
        value: {
            email: 'mark.cavage@joyent.com'
        }
    }

That is, you are passed in the name of the bucket, the name of the key, the
value (as a JS object) the user wanted to write, the bucket configuration, a
bunyan instance you can use to log to the Moray log, and the current Postgres
connection (which is a raw [node-pg](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/)
handle).

### post

The definition for a `post` trigger is nearly identical:


    function myPostTrigger(req, cb) {
        ....
        cb();
    }

Where `req` is an object like this:

    {
        bucket: 'foo',
        key: 'bar',
        id: 123,
        log: <logger>,
        pg: <postgres handle>,
        schema: <index configuration>,
        value: {
            email: 'mark.cavage@joyent.com'
        }
    }

The `req` object is basically the same, except you will now also have the
database `id` (a monotonically increasing sequence number) tacked in as well,
should you want to use that for something.
